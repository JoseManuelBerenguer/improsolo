# Improsolo
2 groups of 8 agents improvisation based on soundfiles 

Improsolo is an application that takes audio files of about 40 to 50 minutes to feed the behavior of two groups of 8 computational agents that act as improvisers.

Each agent is aware of what the others are doing, copying them 70% of the time when making decisions, while the other 30% of the time, it diverges from any behavior that is occurring at the moment of decision-making. Essentially, the agents copy and slightly modify the reading point of the files chosen by the other agents, as well as the transposition of the sound materials and the amount of reverb.

Apart from audio generation, Improsolo also exhibits generative visual behavior based on video files, which, similar to the audio files, can be chosen by the users.

Download the compressed file an uncompress it. Launch itin a demo version of Max (cycling74), and drag audio and videfiles in the dropboxes.
